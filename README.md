**Welcome to the Reactive Extensions (Rx) Koans**

_"Learn by Doing"_

55 progressive examples to help you learn Rx

By: Bart De Smet & Llewellyn Falco 

**Definition of ‘Koan’**

 Koans is a zen word meaning the enlightenment or awakening of a person, usually through a puzzle or riddle. The most common one is “What is the sound of one hand clapping?”

**What is this all about?**

Rx is a new innovative way to work with asynchronous operations on event streams. It is composable, and uses well-known LINQ syntax to easily express complex timing and event processing operations.   

This RxKoans are an interactive and fun way to be introduced to and learn Rx.

**Getting Started** 

Open the Visual Studio 2010 Solution, and open the file:

Koans\Lessons\Lesson0Lambdas.cs

Press Ctrl+R, T (not Ctrl+R, Ctrl+T see below). Fill in the blank (____) Run it again to see it pass.

After you finish the first Lesson, move to the other LessonX files.  

Running the project normally will open this readme file.

**Running Koans**:

**Ctrl R, T** will run the koans. It will run either the single koan your cursor is on, or the whole file, if your cursor is not in a specific koan[Unit Test].

Running in Debug Mode:

**Ctrl R, Ctrl T** will run in Debug mode, we do not suggest this, as it just makes things slower and more confusing.

_note_: Crtl+R,T also takes the current cursor position as a parameter as to which test to run.

**Tips & Tricks** 

**Play**: Experimentation is a powerful learning tool. Don't be afraid to try stuff out, and run it to see what happens.

**Run the Test: **It is valuable to see what the results are. All Koans are designed to produce something even before they are filled in.

**Debug: **Set some break point and walk thru the code. It's a great way to get details. (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+T) will run in debug mode.

**Do Them with a Friend: **Learn is more fun and less frustrating when you have a friend with you.
